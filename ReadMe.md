Quizzical is a web application that allows users to play quizzes that are pulled
from the Open trivia database. Users can select from three categories of difficulty. The questions are multiple choice and the user can see their score at the end of the quiz. The question categories include music, film, gaming, computer knowledge, and an many others.

## How to run the application

Running the application is simple. First, clone the repository to your local machine. Then, navigate to the root directory of the project and run the following command: `open index.html`. This will open the application in your default web browser. **Important! Please make sure you have a stable internet connection before running the application as we are using an API to grab the questions.**
